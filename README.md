# rmhdtod
This code is intended to solve the reduced magnetohydrodynamic equations. The code will be pseudospectral in the perpendicular dimensions and finite difference in the z direction. It is parallelised in two dimensions, y and z for real space variables and kx and z for fourier-space variables).
